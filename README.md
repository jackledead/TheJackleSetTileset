A passion project to bring high res textures to Cataclysm using all the tools available in the modern day, including my dear Stable Diffusion.

This is a very early version. Many things are not textured or do not appear properly, or look like dogshit. Message me if youd like to contribute, this will be cahnging too rapidly on my end for any PRs you make to stay relevent at this stage.

Textures are 128 by 128 pixels.

System RAM Requiremnt of at least 2500 MB available.
